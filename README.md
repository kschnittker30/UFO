# Summary
The webpage is very dynamic in its ability to allow multiple filters to analyze date based on. The user has a lot tools to help focus in on specific data elements. One drawback is the placeholder values. The placeholder values are very useful in giving information to the user on how to input data for filtering. However, when entering actual filter requests the placeholder value looks identical to the actual filter requests. This may cause confusion on the exact filters being utilized. Also, the data filters must each be manually deleted to clear out the filter. A button to remove filters would be suggested. There is also a lot of data presented, so all the various data filters to select is not easily known to user. Another suggestion would be to have each filter box include a drop listing of available data filters to select. This way user can see the various data filter options to pick and can select or type in a option for the filter.
